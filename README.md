This is a photo blogging app that I have made while learning Firebase. I
have implemented features such as a user can like, create, share & delete
posts. User has to sign up/sign in in order to user the app. She/he can set
username, bio and profile picture. I have learned a lot of things about
firebase like Firestore, Database, Crashlytics and Authentication. Also I
have Implemented new Material Design 2 concepts
